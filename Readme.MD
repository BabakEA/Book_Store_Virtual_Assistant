# Book Store Chatbot Prototype

Welcome to the Book Store Chatbot Prototype repository! This project aims to enhance user experience in the realm of online bookstores by leveraging advanced technologies and a vast dataset to offer personalized book recommendations, detailed book information, and seamless interaction for users.

## Overview

The Book Store Chatbot Prototype utilizes a combination of cutting-edge technologies and data management techniques:

- **ChromaDB**: A powerful vector database used for efficient data storage and retrieval, enabling seamless handling of book-related information.
- **OpenAI**: Utilized for Named Entity Recognition (NER), intention detection, summarization, and question answering, ensuring accurate and context-aware responses.
- **FastAPI**: A high-performance framework used to develop the chatbot's API, facilitating rapid communication between the user interface and backend processes.
- **SQLite**: Employed for data management, logging user interactions, and powering the recommendation engine.
- **Streamlit**: Utilized for developing a user-friendly graphical interface, enabling seamless communication with the chatbot.
- **Rasa**: Integrated into the chatbot architecture to facilitate natural language understanding and dialogue management.

## Features

- **Personalized Recommendations**: The chatbot analyzes user search history to identify preferred genres and delivers tailored book recommendations.
- **Information Retrieval**: Users can obtain detailed information about books, authors, or genres using summarization techniques.
- **General Inquiries**: Users can inquire about return policies, purchasing methods, and other general information stored in the database.
- **User Interaction Flow**: A seamless flow of communication where user queries are interpreted, relevant information is retrieved, and user activity is logged for future reference and recommendation.

## Development Process

### GUI Development with Streamlit

Streamlit is utilized to develop a user-friendly graphical interface that enables seamless communication with the chatbot. Through Streamlit's intuitive design and interactive elements, users can initiate conversations, input queries, and receive responses in real-time.

### Chatbot Agent Integration with Rasa

Rasa, an open-source conversational AI platform, is integrated into the chatbot architecture to facilitate natural language understanding and dialogue management. By leveraging Rasa's machine learning capabilities and pre-built components, the chatbot agent can interpret user intents, extract entities, and generate contextually relevant responses.

### Testing and Iteration

Rigorous testing and iteration are conducted throughout the development process to ensure the functionality, performance, and usability of the chatbot prototype. User feedback and testing results are collected and incorporated into the development cycle to refine the user experience and address any issues or limitations encountered.

## Future Development

As the chatbot prototype evolves, future development efforts may focus on enhancing the GUI interface, expanding the chatbot's capabilities and domain knowledge, and integrating additional features and functionalities to further enrich the user experience. Collaboration with stakeholders and end-users will continue to drive innovation and improvement in the chatbot's design and functionality.
